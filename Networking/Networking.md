# Networking


# Network Essentials

**Computer Network**: A Collection of Computers or devices connected together through connecting media to perform a certain task.

**Resources can be shared:**
- File
- Devices
- Software with multi-user licenses.
- Voice and Video calls
- Internet Access

**Network Elements**
- Hardware
    - Devices
    - Medium: Wired, Wireless, Satellites
- Software
    - Messages: that travels over the medium
    - Protocols: Governs how message flow across network

# Network Terminologies 

- Network Interface Card (NIC) / Network Adapter / LAN Adapter

        A hardware that enable the device to directly access the network

- MAC Address (Physical Address)

        A unique address over the world burned on the NIC card

- IP Address

        Logical address identify the device over the network

- Protocols

        Communication rules

- Hub

        Allow different nodes to communicate with each other at the same network (Slow the network)

- Switch 

        Allow different nodes to communicate with each other at the same network and time without slowing the network

- Repeater

        Regenerate the signal before it becomes weak or corrupted

- Access point (AP)

        Allow wireless devices to connect with wired network

- Router

        Allow different networks to communicate with each other

# LAN & WAN
- Local Area Networks (LAN)
- Wide Area Networks (WAN)

# Internet
A global mesh of interconnected networks

**No one actually owns the internet**
- ICANN: Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers

# OSI Model
Open Systems Interconnect, was defined by ISO in 1983, Give developers universal concepts so they can develop protocols.

**OSI Layers (7 Layers)**
- Application Layer
- Presentation Layer
- Session Layer
- Transport Layer
- Network Layer
- Data Link Layer
- Physical Layer

**TCP/IP Original Layers (4 Layers)**
- Application Layer
- Transport Layer
- Internet Layer
- Link Layer

**TCP/IP Updated Layers (5 Layers)**
- Application Layer 
- Transport Layer
- Network Layer
- Data Link Layer
- Physical Layer


# Network Access Layer
- Physical Layer: defines the electrical Transmission medium.
- Data Link Layer: Logical interface between end system and network, Error notification.


# Physical Address
- Burned on NIC card
- Unique address over the world
- 48-bit (6-byte) written as 12 hexadecimal digits
- every byte (2 hexadecimal digits) is separated by a colon

**Physical address can be:**
- Unicast: one client send to one client
- Multicast: one client send to group of clients
- Broadcast: one client send to all clients
